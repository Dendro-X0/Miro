## Customization & Roadmap

Miro is intentionally small and modular. Common ways to extend it include:

- **AI capabilities** – plug in additional models and tools via the `@miro/ai` package.
- **Workspace model** – adapt the schema in `@miro/db` to your own domain (boards, documents, flows).
- **UI shell** – build richer layouts and components in your app clients.
- **Integrations** – add third-party integrations to the API layer.
