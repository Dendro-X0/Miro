# Miro Docs

This folder contains documentation for the Miro Workspace monorepo. It is meant to complement the top‑level `README.md` with more focused, long‑form guides.

## Index

- [Overview](./overview.md) – high‑level description of the project and ways to customize it.
- [Stack](./stack.md) – libraries, tools, and platforms used across apps and packages.
- [Architecture](./architecture.md) – monorepo layout and how data and control flow through the system.
- [Usage](./usage.md) – prerequisites, installation, and development workflow.

You can link to these documents directly from GitHub, or treat this directory as the starting point for a more complete documentation site in the future.
